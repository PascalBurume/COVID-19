# COVID-19 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread to become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people worldwide.

The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, but the disease can also cause other symptoms such as fatigue, body aches, and loss of smell or taste.

To prevent the spread of the virus, health authorities recommend practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and wearing masks in public, avoiding close contact with others, and getting vaccinated against COVID-19 when a vaccine is available. Many countries have also implemented social distancing measures, such as lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings, to slow the spread of the virus.

## Dashboard

The COVID-19 dashboard typically provides an overview of the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as other relevant information, such as the number of active cases, hospitalizations, and vaccinations.

The dashboard may include visualizations such as graphs and charts to help people understand the trends and patterns in the data. For example, a graph might show the daily number of new cases or deaths over time, while a map might show the geographic distribution of cases.

The dashboard is typically updated regularly to reflect the latest information available, and may include information at the national, state/provincial, or local level. It is designed to be a helpful resource for people who want to stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic and make informed decisions about their health and safety.
## Confirmed
The "confirmed" section provides information about the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, broken down by country or region. This information is presented in the form of  a graph, map, and may be interactive, allowing the user to explore the data in more detail.

The decomposition tree is a visualization tool that can help users explore the data in more detail by breaking down the total number of confirmed cases by various factors, such as country by total case.

This information can be helpful for understanding the patterns and trends in the data, and for identifying areas where targeted interventions might be needed to control the spread of the virus.

## Death
The "death" section  provides information about the total number of deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide, broken down by country or region. This information is  presented in the form of  a graph, or a map, and may be interactive, allowing the user to explore the data in more detail.

The decomposition tree is a visualization tool that can help users explore the data in more detail by breaking down the total number of death cases by various factors, such as country by total case.

This information can be helpful for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on different populations and for identifying areas where targeted interventions might be needed to reduce the number of deaths associated with the virus.

## Recovered
The "recovered" section  provides information about the total number of recovered associated with COVID-19 worldwide, broken down by country or region. This information is  presented in the form of  a graph, or a map, and may be interactive, allowing the user to explore the data in more detail.

The decomposition tree is a visualization tool that can help users explore the data in more detail by breaking down the total number of recovered cases by various factors, such as country by total case.
