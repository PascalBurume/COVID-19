# COVID-19 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The disease was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread to become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people worldwide.

The virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, but the disease can also cause other symptoms such as fatigue, body aches, and loss of smell or taste.

To prevent the spread of the virus, health authorities recommend practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and wearing masks in public, avoiding close contact with others, and getting vaccinated against COVID-19 when a vaccine is available. Many countries have also implemented social distancing measures, such as lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings, to slow the spread of the virus.
